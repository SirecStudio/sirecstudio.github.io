**Overview**



**SS-Stable** is the ultimate and most advanced stable management system for RedM, offering a complete suite of features for horse and wagon ownership, training, taming, breeding, equipment customization, selling, and more. Designed with immersion and realism in mind, this system transforms the way players interact with their horses and wagons, creating an unparalleled roleplay experience.

Whether you're running a large economy server or a smaller roleplay-focused community, SS-Stable provides the flexibility, depth, and performance to handle every aspect of stable life. From animated training routines and genetic-based breeding to an online marketplace and personal stables with individual inventories, every feature is carefully built to simulate a real horse world.
