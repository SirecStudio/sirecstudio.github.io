# SS-Core

Our SS-_CORE_ script is the essential foundation that powers and coordinates all other scripts in our RedM suite. Designed as a centralized support system, the _CORE_ provides a unified and versatile interface, ensuring each script can operate optimally regardless of the underlying framework (such as RSG, VORP, etc.). Thanks to the SS-_CORE_, users can benefit from a consistent setup and streamlined management of features.



### What Does the SS-CORE Do?

* **Compatibility Bridge**: The _CORE_ acts as a bridge that automatically identifies and applies the correct functions and methods for the framework in use. This means that whether the server runs RSG, VORP, or another framework, the SS-_CORE_ adapts seamlessly, maintaining full compatibility.
* **Centralized Function Management**: With the SS-_CORE_, thereâ€™s no need to configure each script individually for framework alignment. Core functions such as user authentication, inventory management, transactions, and more are centralized within the SS-_CORE_. This way, every script can access the same resources and work in harmony without additional configuration.
* **Efficiency and Optimization**: The SS-_CORE_ is designed to reduce overhead and eliminate redundancies. By managing primary calls and ensuring synchronized operations, it improves the server's overall efficiency and optimizes resource usage, ensuring a smoother experience for all users.
* **Configurability and Modularity**: We structured the SS-_CORE_ to be highly modular. You can enable or disable specific functions as needed, allowing for customization without compromising the stability of other scripts.





### Why is the CORE Essential?

The _SS-CORE_ serves as the backbone for all other scripts. Its presence provides greater flexibility and significantly reduces compatibility issues that can arise when working with different frameworks. Here are the main benefits:

* **Scalability**: With the _SS-CORE_ , adding new scripts to an existing configuration is simple, as each one is designed to work natively with it.
* **Simplified Maintenance**: Since core functions are centralized, updating or fixing issues is more efficient. Any improvements to the _SS-CORE_ are instantly reflected across all scripts that rely on it.
* **Consistency**: The _SS-CORE_ ensures that each script follows the same operational standards and logic, offering a uniform and predictable experience for admins and players alike.
