# How to Configure the SS-CORE

Follow these steps to properly configure the _SS-CORE_ script on your RedM server:

#### Step 1: Set Your Server IP on the Website

1. Go to your account page on our website: [https://www.sirecstudio.com/account/my-account](https://www.sirecstudio.com/account/my-account).
2. Make sure to enter your serverâ€™s IP address in the designated field. This is crucial for linking your server with the license. You need enter only the IP without the port.

#### Step 2: Configure the License in SS-Core

1. Open the file `SS-Core/license.lua`.
2. In this file, locate the `YourSSLicense` variable.
3. Copy the license key from your account page (where you set the IP) and paste it as the value of `YourSSLicense`.

#### Step 3: Set Your Steam Access for CORE Panel Access

1. In `SS-Core`, open the file that controls access permissions (usually found in `config.lua` or similar).
2. Locate the `SteamAccess` variable.
3. Enter your Steam ID here to allow access to the CORE panel, enabling you to manage your scripts directly in-game.

#### Step 4: Enable SS-Core in server.cfg

1. After setting up the previous configurations, add `ensure SS-Core` in your `server.cfg` file. And all the others SS scripts must be below SS-Core.
