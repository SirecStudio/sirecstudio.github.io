**Overview**

**SS-Bank** is the most comprehensive and immersive banking system designed for RedM, featuring an advanced suite of tools for player and director-level financial management. Built for both roleplay immersion and economic depth, SS-Bank offers full support for real-time player banking, gold market simulation, director control systems, salary automation, and secure stash interactions.

This modular system handles all aspects of in-game banking, from classic deposit/withdraw systems to check creation, salary distribution, loan processing, taxation, market price simulation, and gold trading. Players can manage both their **money and gold accounts**, request and repay loans, generate checks, and even access market data with dynamic pricing. Meanwhile, **bank directors** have access to backend controls to manage stashes, freeze accounts, issue salaries, oversee customers, and view logs with full transparency.

Whether you're looking to simulate a historical bank, introduce a functional economy, or roleplay a professional financial director, SS-Bank provides all the tools needed to build a living, breathing economy inside your RedM server.
