**Overview**

\
SS-Metabolism is a fully integrated and highly configurable metabolism system for RedM, designed to enhance realism by managing key survival mechanics such as hunger, thirst, stress, dirtiness, reputation, and temperature. This system dynamically adjusts based on player actions, environmental conditions, and reputation levels, providing an immersive experience.

The system also includes **horse metabolism support** when used with SS-Stable, allowing players to monitor their horse's hunger, thirst, stamina, and health in real-time. The **drag-and-save HUD customization** ensures that players can position the interface to their preference, with settings saved automatically for a seamless experience.
