# Receive a telegram

The script will check every X seconds to see if you have a new telegram unread !

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```lua
TimeCheck = 60, 
ResetTelegram = 600, 
```
{% endcode %}

You will be notified about the new telegram and the bird will fly above you untill you call it, because you can receive a telegram in the wrong moment, fighting, roleplay, inside an interior and it can bother you in some moments like that. So the Telegram will fly above you untill you call it, and then you can read it.
